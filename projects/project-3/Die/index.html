    <h1>They Both Die at the End</h1>
    <p>“My chest tightens. I’m dying today.</p>
        <p>
            I’ve always been afraid of dying. I don’t know why I thought this would jinx it from actually happening. Not
            forever, obviously, but long enough so I could grow up. Dad has even been drilling it into my head that I should
            pretend I’m the main character of a story that nothing bad ever happens to, most especially death, because the
            hero has to be around to save the day. But the noise in my head is quieting down and there’s a Death-Cast herald
            on the other end of the phone waiting to tell me I’m going to die today at eighteen years old.
        </p>
        <p>Wow, I’m actually . . .</p>
        <p>
            I don’t want to pick up the phone. I’d rather run into Dad’s bedroom and curse into a pillow because he chose
            the wrong time to land himself in intensive care, or punch a wall because my mom marked me for an early death
            when she died giving birth to me. The phone rings for what’s got to be the thirtieth time, and I can’t avoid it
            any more than I can avoid what’s going down sometime today.
        </p>
        <p>
            I slide my laptop off my crossed legs and get up from my bed, swaying to the side, feeling really faint. I’m
            like a zombie moving toward my desk, slow and walking-dead.
        </p>
        <p>The caller ID reads DEATH-CAST, of course.</p>
        <p>
            I’m shaking but manage to press Talk. I don’t say anything. I’m not sure what to say. I just breathe because I
            have fewer than twenty-eight thousand breaths left in me—the average number of breaths a nondying person takes
            per day—and I might as well use them up while I can.”
