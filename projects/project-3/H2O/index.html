    <h1>H2O</h1>
    <p>“It wasn't like I was about to run out into the rain. There was a kind of carport thing outside, a place where
        they stored all sorts of (hippie) junk nd chopped wood. Their cars — a little zippy thing they used to get to
        yoga classes (hopefully wearing clothes on the journey) and this other beat-up big one, a station wagon — were
        parked there. So it'd be wrong if you in any way thought I was being brave. I really wasn't. I don't know what
        exactly I was thinking. I wasn't thinking.”</p>
