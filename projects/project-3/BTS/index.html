    <h1>Beyond The Story</h1>
    <p>
        “Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. Today, I am who I am with all my faults and
        my mistakes. Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’ll be me too. These faults and mistakes are what I
        am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have to come to love myself for who I am,
        for who I was, and for who I hope to become. [RM, ch. 5, BTS' first UN speech]”
