    <h1>The Princess Bride</h1>
    <p>
        “Do I love you? My God, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches…I have stayed
            these years in my hovel because of you. I have taught myself languages because of you. I have made my body
            strong because I thought you might be pleased by a strong body. I have lived my life with only the prayer that
            some sudden dawn you might glance in my direction. I have not known a moment in years when the sight of you did
            not send my heart careening against my rib cage. I have not known a night when your visage did not accompany me
            to sleep. There has not been a morning when you did not flutter behind my waking eyelids…
    </p>

        <p>
            I love you. Okay? Want it louder? I love you. Spell it out, should I? I ell-oh-vee-ee why-oh-you. Want it
            backward? You love I.”
