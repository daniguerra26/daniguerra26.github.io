    <h1>Censorship</h1>
    <p>Censorship is the <span>suppression of speech</span>, public communication, or other information. This may be done on the
        basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or <span>"inconvenient".</span>[2][3][4] Censorship
        can be conducted by governments,[5] private institutions,[6] and other controlling bodies.</p>

    <p>Governments[5] and private organizations may engage in censorship. Other groups or institutions may propose and
        petition for censorship.[6] When an individual such as an author or other creator engages in censorship of their
        own works or speech, it is referred to as <span>self-censorship.</span> General censorship occurs in a variety of different
        media, including speech, books, music, films, and other arts, the press, radio, television, and the Internet for
        a variety of claimed reasons including national security, to control obscenity, pornography, and hate speech, to
        protect children or other vulnerable groups, to <span>promote or restrict</span> political or religious views, and to prevent
        slander and libel. Specific rules and regulations regarding censorship vary between legal jurisdictions and/or
        private organizations.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In 399 BC, Greek philosopher, Socrates, while defying attempts by the Athenian state to censor his philosophical
        teachings, was accused of collateral charges related to the corruption of Athenian youth and sentenced to death
        by drinking a poison, hemlock.</p>

    <p>The details of Socrates's conviction are recorded by Plato as follows. In 399 BC, Socrates went on trial[8] and
        was subsequently found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety (asebeia,[9]
        "not believing in the gods of the state"),[10] and as a punishment sentenced to death, caused by the drinking of
        a mixture containing hemlock.[11][12][13]</p>

    <p>Socrates' student, Plato, is said to have advocated censorship in his essay on The Republic, which opposed the
        existence of democracy. In contrast to Plato, Greek playwright Euripides (480â€“406 BC) defended the true liberty
        of freeborn men, including the right to speak freely. In 1766, Sweden became the first country to abolish
        censorship by law.[14</p>
    <h2>Rationale and Criticism</h2>
    <p>Censorship has been criticized throughout history for being unfair and hindering progress. In a 1997 essay on
        Internet censorship, social commentator Michael Landier explains that <span>censorship is counterproductive</span> as it
        prevents the censored topic from being discussed. Landier expands his argument by claiming that those who impose
        censorship must consider what they censor to be true, as individuals believing themselves to be correct would
        welcome the opportunity to disprove those with opposing views.[15]</p>

    <p>Censorship is often used to impose moral values on society, as in the censorship of material considered obscene.
        English novelist E. M. Forster was a staunch opponent of censoring material on the grounds that it was obscene
        or immoral, raising the issue of moral subjectivity and the constant changing of moral values. When the 1928
        novel Lady Chatterley's Lover was put on trial in 1960, Forster wrote:[16]</p>

    <p>Lady Chatterley's Lover is a literary work of importance...I do not think that it could be held obscene, but am
        in a difficulty here, for the reason that I have never been able to follow the legal definition of obscenity.
        The law tells me that obscenity may deprave and corrupt, but as far as I know, it offers no definition of
        depravity or corruption.</p>

    <p>Proponents have sought to justify it using different rationales for various types of information censored:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Moral censorship is the <span>removal of materials</span> that are obscene or otherwise considered morally questionable.</li>
        <li>
            Pornography, for example, is often censored under this rationale, especially child pornography, which is illegal
            and censored in most jurisdictions in the world.[17][18]
        </li>
        <li>
            Military censorship is the process of keeping military intelligence and tactics <span>confidential</span> and away from the
            enemy. This is used to counter espionage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Political censorship occurs when governments <span>hold back information</span> from their citizens. This is often done to
            exert control over the populace and prevent free expression that might foment rebellion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Religious censorship is the means by which any material considered <span>objectionable</span> by a certain religion is
            removed. This often involves a dominant religion forcing limitations on less prevalent ones. Alternatively, one
            religion may shun the works of another when they believe the content is not appropriate for their religion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Corporate censorship is the process by which editors in corporate media outlets <span>intervene to disrupt</span> the
            publishing of information that portrays their business or business partners in a negative light,[19][20] or
            intervene to prevent alternate offers from reaching public exposure.[21]
