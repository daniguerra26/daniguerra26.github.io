    <h2 id="state-secrets">State Secrets and Prevention of Attention</h2>
    <p>In wartime, explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of <span>preventing the release of information</span> that
        might be useful to an enemy. Typically it involves keeping times or locations <span>
            secret, or delaying the release of
            information
        </span> (e.g., an operational objective) until it is of no possible use to enemy forces. The moral issues
        here are often seen as somewhat different, as the proponents of this form of censorship argue that the release
        of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one's own forces and could possibly
        lead to loss of the overall conflict.</p>

    <p>
        During World War I letters written by British soldiers would have to go through censorship. This consisted of
        officers going through letters with a black marker and <span>crossing out anything</span> which might compromise operational
        secrecy before the letter was sent.[22] The World War II catchphrase "Loose lips sink ships" was used as a
        common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing
        potentially sensitive information.[23]

    <p>
        An example of "sanitization" policies comes from the USSR under Joseph Stalin, where publicly used photographs
        were often altered to remove people whom Stalin had condemned to execution. Though past photographs may have
        been remembered or kept, this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen
        as one of the central themes of Stalinism and totalitarianism.
    </p>

    <p>Censorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual, as with some kidnappings
        when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful.[24]</p>
    <h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
    <p>Censorship by religion is a form of censorship where freedom of expression is <span>controlled or limited</span> using
        religious authority or on the basis of the teachings of the religion.[25] This form of censorship has a long
        history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the Galileo affair, Edict of
        Compiègne, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of Salman Rushdie's
        novel The Satanic Verses by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Images of the Islamic figure Muhammad
        are also regularly censored. In some secular countries, this is sometimes done to prevent hurting religious
        sentiments.[26]</p>
    <h2 id="education">Educational Sources</h2>
    <p>The content of school textbooks is often an issue of debate, since their target audiences are young people. The
        term <span>whitewashing</span> is commonly used to refer to revisionism aimed at glossing over difficult or questionable
        historical events, or a biased presentation thereof. The reporting of military atrocities in history is
        extremely controversial, as in the case of the Holocaust (or Holocaust denial), Bombing of Dresden, the Nanking
        Massacre as found with Japanese history textbook controversies, the Armenian genocide, the Tiananmen Square
        protests of 1989, and the Winter Soldier Investigation of the Vietnam War.</p>
    <p>
        In the context of secondary school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the
        interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One argument for censoring the type of
        information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the younger public. <span>
            The use of the "inappropriate" distinction is in itself controversial, as it changed heavily.
        </span> A Ballantine Books version
        of the book Fahrenheit 451 which is the version used by most school classes[27] contained approximately 75
        separate edits, omissions, and changes from the original Bradbury manuscript.
    </p>

    <p>In February 2006, a National Geographic cover was censored by the Nashravaran Journalistic Institute. The
        offending cover was about the subject of love and a picture of an embracing couple was hidden beneath a white
        sticker.[28]</p>
    <h2 id="economy">Economic Induced Censorship</h2>
    <p>Economic induced censorship is a type of censorship enacted by economic markets <span>
        to favor, and disregard, types of information.
    </span> Economic induced censorship, is also caused, by market forces which privatize and establish
        commodification of certain <span>information that is not accessible by the general public,</span> primarily because of the
        cost associated with commodified information such as academic journals, industry reports and pay to use
        repositories.[29]</p>

    <p>>The concept was illustrated as a censorship pyramid[30] that was conceptualized by primarily Julian Assange,
        along with Andy Müller-Maguhn, Jacob Appelbaum and Jérémie Zimmermann, in the Cypherpunks (book).</p>
    <h2 id="self">Self-censorship</h2>
    <p>Self-censorship is the act of <span>censoring or classifying one's own discourse.</span> This is done out of fear of, or
        deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from
        any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film
        directors, publishers, news anchors, journalists, musicians, and other kinds of authors including individuals
        who use social media.[32]</p>

    <p>
        According to a Pew Research Center and the Columbia Journalism Review survey, "About one-quarter of the local
        and national journalists say they have purposely avoided newsworthy stories, while nearly as many acknowledge
        they have softened the tone of stories to benefit the interests of their news organizations. Fully four-in-ten
        (41%) admit they have engaged in either or both of these practices."[33]
    </p>

    <p>Threats to media freedom have shown a significant increase in Europe in recent years, according to a study
        published in April 2017 by the Council of Europe. This results in a fear of physical or psychological violence,
        and the ultimate result is self-censorship by journalists.[34]</p>
    <h2 id="copy">Copy, Picture, and Writer Approval</h2>
    <p>Copy approval is the right to read and amend an article, usually an interview, before publication. Many
        publications <span>refuse to give copy approval</span> but it is increasingly becoming common practice when dealing with
        publicity anxious celebrities.[35] Picture approval is the right given to an individual to choose which photos
        will be published and <span>which will not.</span> Robert Redford is well known for insisting upon picture approval.[36]
        Writer approval is when writers are chosen based on whether they will write flattering articles or not.
        Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley is known for <span>banning certain writers</span> who wrote undesirably about one of her
        clients from interviewing any of her other clients.</p>
    <h2 id="reverse">Reverse Censorship</h2>
    <p>Flooding the public, often through online social networks, with <span>false or misleading information</span> is sometimes
        called "reverse censorship". American legal scholar Tim Wu has explained that this type of information control,
        sometimes by state actors, can "distort or drown out disfavored speech through the creation and dissemination of
        fake news, the payment of fake commentators, and the deployment of propaganda robots."[37]</p>
